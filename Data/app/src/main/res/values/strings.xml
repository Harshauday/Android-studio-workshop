        Starting in Android 11 (API level 30), the system caches large datasets that multiple
        apps might access for use cases like machine learning and media playback.
        This functionality helps reduce data redundancy, both over the network and on disk.
        When your app needs access to a shared large dataset, it can first look for these cached datasets,
        called shared data blobs, before determining whether to download a new copy. Apps can access these
        shared datasets functionality using the APIs in boldstoremanager
        The system represents each shared data blob using a BlobHandle object. Each instance of BlobHandle contains
        a cryptographically-secure hash and some identifying details for the dataset.
        To access shared data blobs, download identifying details from the server.
        Using these details, check whether the dataset is already available on the system.
        The next step depends on whether data is available
